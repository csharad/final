        <h2>History</h2>
        <p> Coffee was first grown on the Arabian Peninsula in the 15th century. It was enjoyed by the rich and the poor alike.
          By the 17th century, European travellers had spread word of this wondrous bean and popularized consumption in the West
          as well. Coffee began to replace beer and wine, which was previously drank at European breakfasts. It was brought to the
          Americas by French colonizers, where it has only grown in popularity since. </p>

            <h3>Geography</h3>
            <p>This is the coffee belt. Over 80% of the world's coffee today comes from these regions.
              The latitude (or latte-tude!) of this region has the perfect weather for the coffee plant to grow. This includes
              levels of rainfall vs. a dry season, sunny days with cooler nighttime temperatures, and fertile
              soil for the coffee trees to thrive.</p>
            <p> There are countries more specifically known for their coffee growing. Papua New Guinea, Brazil, Sumatra,
              Columbia, and Peru are world-famous. </p>
